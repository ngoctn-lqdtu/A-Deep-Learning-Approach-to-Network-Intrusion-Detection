# A-Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Network-Intrusion-Detection
This is an implementation on Google Colab Notebook of the deep learning classification model constructed using stacked nonsymmetric deep autoencoder (NDAE) and Random Forest algorithm on KDD Cup'99 dataset. This model is proposed in the article "A Deep Learning Approach to Network Intrusion Detection" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8264962)
